# Santization Guidelines for PPTX Files
1. What to remove from project documents:
    a. Names and contacts
        - Remove names logos, emails, phone numbers anything that reveals identities
    b. Client Specific Terms
        - Take out acronyms, internal terms and unique taxonomies that aren't general business concepts
    c. (Hidden) Connections
        - Replace all names of subsidiaries, parent companies, partner firms, vendors and suppliers - also those not obviously linked to the client
    d. Market Context
        - Disguise all non-public references revealing a client's market context, e.g. market position, competitive landscape, and any implicit or explicit geographical identifiers, such as local currency
        - Market insights based on SK research? Check sources for public availability before sharing!
    e. Non-public Insights
        - Eliminate all non-public hints to commercial strategies, cost structures, production capacities, output volumes etc.
        - Purchased data? Check license before sharing!
    f. Visuals and Graphics
        - Ensure no client-specific charts, hidden identifiers or specifics designs & layouts remain
