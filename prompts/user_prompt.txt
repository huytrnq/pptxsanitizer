Please analyze the slide image and the extracted text elements to identify ALL sensitive information that needs sanitization according to the comprehensive rules provided.

The extracted text is provided as a Python list where each element represents text found on the slide. You must examine both the visual slide and the text elements to understand context and identify sensitive content.

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:
- ALL sanitized replacements must use square brackets: [Generic Term]
- Example: "USPS" becomes "[Client]"
- Example: "McKinsey & Company" becomes "[Consulting Partner]"
- Example: "$5.2 billion" becomes "[X] billion"

Return your response as a JSON object:
- "original": the exact text from the list that needs to be replaced
- "replacement": the sanitized version using square brackets
- "category": the type of sensitive information
- "reason": brief explanation of why this needs sanitization

Be thorough and identify ALL sensitive content including:
- Company names, subsidiaries, partners, vendors
- Personal names, titles, contact information
- Financial figures, metrics, percentages
- Product names, internal codes, project names
- Legislation names, regulatory references
- Any content that could identify the client or reveal confidential information
