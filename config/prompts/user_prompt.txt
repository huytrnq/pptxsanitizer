Please examine both the attached slide image and the Python-pptx Extracted Text List shown below.
Identify every text fragment that must be sanitized under the system-level rules.

For each fragment return a JSON object with:
	•	"original"  – the exact substring to be replaced (case-preserved)
	•	"replacement" – the generic substitute, enclosed in square brackets (e.g. "[Client]")
	•	"category"    – concise label such as company_name, acronym, legislation, financial_data, market_context, numerical_value, visual_identifier, etc.
	•	"reason"      – short statement (≤ 15 words) explaining why the fragment is sensitive
	•	"sensitivity_level" – one of HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
  * HIGH  = uniquely identifies client or reveals non-public strategy/finances
  * MEDIUM = could indirectly identify or disclose scale/timing
  * LOW  = mildly sensitive but still requires masking

Output: a single JSON array (no wrapper keys, no commentary). Keep list order independent of input order.
